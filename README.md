# ekoo(Eco Kids of Ontario):EKOO is an online platform for elementary schools to allow students to track the progress of their eco-schools initiative and compare it with other schools in Ontario. We are also gamifying the current system of data collection to increase engagement of students.

If this were to be utilized by current eco-schools to increase the accuracy of data collected as well as making students more engaged, we would be want to implement this system within elementary schools nationally, then globally.

To run the folder "ekoo_withDB":
